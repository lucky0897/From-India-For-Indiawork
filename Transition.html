<!-- for transition u write the property u want to apply it too so transform and then you write the amount of seconds witha "s" and  then the transformation will take that many seconds -->



<!-- the transformation will take that many second to start -->

<!-- 
linear means one line and ease and linear makes them go smotherr 
ease will start slow and the nbecome fast and then end slow
The TRANSITION CURVE
Linear is only one sppeed from start to end
theese are for transistion-timing-function-->


<!-- transition works for anything but u MUST specify thhough it mostly used with the transform property -->

<!-- rotate x is horizontaly and y is verticaly and the z axis is the normal rotation -->
